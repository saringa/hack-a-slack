# TO-DO


## Feed
After Login / Signup or directly from the homepage, I want to enter the Feed of my related Team (Ironhack). In this view, I want to be able to see all the Posts from the last 24 Hours in an ordered order, after Up- and Down-Votes and filtered, if the message is posted (status). As a User I should see a Button for a new post and should be able to click on a post to see the comments. 

## New Post
After Clicking on "New Post", I should be able to add content to my already created, but empty, post. If I do not edit anything, the post should be deleted afterwards again. After submitting, the stated of posted should be true.

## Post
After clicking on "save" for a new post, it should be redirected to the post-view of this post, where I am able to make a new comment or to up- or downvote it. I should also be able to go back to my feed-page.

## Edit profile
In this view, I should be able to change my password and my hackername.

# Backlog

## Add comments
As a hacker, it would be nice to add comments to a post (which could count as upvotes).

## AJAX
Make the feed, the post and others views with ajax.

## Include a file-upload
As a hacker, it would be perfect, to be able to upload pictures / gifs.

## Google Maps
As a hacker, it would be perfect to only see the posts in my city and see my location on the feed.

## Events
As a hacker, it would be nice to also set up events, which are not anonymous and people can join them.

## Edit a post
As a hacker, it would be nice, to be able to edit or delete a post. We need a new route for that (/feed/:id/edit as get and post).

## View hacker profiles
As a hacker, it would be nice to see other hacker-pages
